## Questions

<details><summary>Why doesn't my program work?</summary>

Your DBN program might have used features that exist in the original DBN but haven't implemented in dbnjs. I do not have the book by John Maeda, so I have to rely on the informations I can find. If you found any keywords or commands in DBN that behave differently in dbnjs, feel free to let me know.
